## 3. Todo
- Manage the authentication directly from the app (GitHub REST API works without a token, however, there exists a limit of 60 requests)
- Secure unexpected cases (eg. failed authorization, achieved the limit of requests)
- Create the layout
- Further development: language usage by time, time series charts, forecasting
